# Game Movement Copy

Many games, especially platform jumping games, require you to perform the same operation repeatedly to advance, but it is difficult for ordinary players to advance to the last position in one go, and we often make _mistakes_ in the middle. This is very frustrating, especially when we need to repeat the same action over and over again to reach the last progress, advance a little, and then die... We play games, not to train hand muscle memory!

Repeating the same action over and over is difficult and boring, so this project aims to help players complete the last successful operation with accurate memory, and then players can take over the program at any time and continue the game based on the last time.
